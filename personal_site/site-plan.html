        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The content of this page will consist mostly of doctrinal questions with resources to find answers to these questions. I am thinking of having it link to certain scriptures and conference talks within the church's website, as well as possibly giving users the option to add their own responses to questions or add questions of their own, like an open discussion board. However for the basic concept, I will start out by adding a few common questions that I know of and then adding answers with links to scriptures and conference talks. I'm unsure if I will be able to effectively link my website to the sources I want, so another option would be to just insert the desired information for the answers, maybe just in a different format. Style wise, I think I will lay it out where users can select what questions they want to find answers to and either have it link them to another page with the answers, or have them select a drop down arrow to see the answer. Another possible format would be to lay it out like a discussion board where users can add and respond to other people's quetions. I think the latter format might be more helpful for the users because it will allow them to work together and support each other. Users will want to come to my page for this reason, as it gives them a support that other websites and even the church website does not give. Although I do think it will be important to link my website to the church's in a variety of ways, perhaps most importantly linking users to the "topics and questions" section. For this website and with my limited knowledge, I'm not sure if I will be able to set up a discussion type page. Most likely, the easiest route will be to present the information in a way that is easy to understand and can give satisfactory answers to a few questions. For example, I could give a question like "why do I need the Book of Mormon if I have the Bible?" and then link that to several different passages from general conference or from the scriptures that can give answers to that question. Making this website will require me to do a lot of research on different topics and common questions that we get as members of the church. Which is part of the reason I chose this topic because it also gives me a reason to enhance my study of the gospel. Through the content of this website I hope to be able to strengthen the testimonies of everyone who visits the site by giving them satisfactory answers to their gospel questions. Obviously not every gospel question can be fully answered, in order to understand many questions and concerns it simply takes faith and trust in the Lord. So I don't expect to be able to answer every question, but my hope is that I can help members to be able to answer these questions, even if the answer is that there is no answer or that we simply don't know. I also don't want this to be a website for "bashing." My goal isn't to help people win their arguments with their evangelical friends. But hopefully users can leave my site with a better understaning of the scriptures, and of the doctrine, or maybe even of just how to respond when people ask difficult questions so that other people can understand our religion better. It isn't about proving us right or about proving them wrong, but about building connections and realizing that we aren't so different. We both believe in Jesus Christ as the savior of the world, and although we have different doctrinal beliefs, the core is the same and we can build bridges of understanding.
