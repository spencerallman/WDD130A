            <h2>Why is the Book of Mormon so important?</h2>
            <p>Former prophet Ezra Taft Benson is quoted as saying that the Book of Mormon is the "keystone of our religion" in three different ways: </p><p>"It is the keystone in our witness of Christ. It is the keystone of our doctrine. It is the keystone of testimony.The Book of Mormon is the keystone in our witness of Jesus Christ, who is Himself the cornerstone of everything we do. It bears witness of His reality with power and clarity. Unlike the Bible, which passed through generations of copyists, translators, and corrupt religionists who tampered with the text, the Book of Mormon came from writer to reader in just one inspired step of translation. Therefore, its testimony of the Master is clear, undiluted, and full of power. But it does even more. Much of the Christian world today rejects the divinity of the Savior. They question His miraculous birth, His perfect life, and the reality of His glorious resurrection. The Book of Mormon teaches in plain and unmistakable terms about the truth of all of those. It also provides the most complete explanation of the doctrine of the Atonement. Truly, this divinely inspired book is a keystone in bearing witness to the world that Jesus is the Christ." </p>

            <h2>What does it mean to be "saved?"</h2>
            <p>Elder Dallin H Oaks in the quorum of the twelve apostles addressed this question in a conference address in 1998 when he said:</p>
            <p>"To Latter-day Saints, the words saved and salvation in this teaching signify a present covenant relationship with Jesus Christ in which we are assured salvation from the consequences of sin if we are obedient. Every sincere Latter-day Saint is “saved” according to this meaning. We have been converted to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we have experienced repentance and baptism, and we are renewing our covenants of baptism by partaking of the sacrament."</p>

            <h2>What is the Word of Wisdom and why is it important?</h2>
            <p>The Word of Wisdom is a health law that was revealed to the prophet Joseph Smith in 1833. It is contained in the 89th section of the Doctrine and Covenants and here is what it entails:</p>
            <p>The following substances were revealed to be harmful: Alcoholic drinks, tobacco, tea and coffee, and illegal drugs.</p>
            <p>The Word of Wisdom also encourages the following: fruits, vegetables, meats, grains, rice, and oats.</p>
            <p>Why is it important? At the end of section 89 the Lord gives the following promises to those who keep the Word of Wisdom:</p>
            <p>"18 And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;</p>

            <p>19 And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;</p>
            
            <p>20 And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.</p>
            
            <p>21 And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen."</p>
